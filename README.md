HOW TO RUN CODE: open .jucer file in projucer and place finalproject folder in JUCE folder. Make sure to specify path to modules.
HOW TO USE PLUGIN: Put .vst3 file in your Plugin folder and open in DAW of choice

Despite the many challenges, I had a lot of fun on this project and it had many great learning oppertunities. I had never used C++
before so I had to spend a lot of time learning how it worked and the header file and cpp file thing confused me at first. What I enjoyed
most about it is once I finaly got the fuzz working it was such a feeling of accomplishment. I watched JUCE tutorials to help me 
understand what I was doing but there were no distortion tutorials that I used so the fact that I built it by myself was a great feeling.
I really liked that I could make something that I am passionate about to and it has inspired me to go down the road of guitar plugin
creation; an admitidly niche market but something I would love doing. I also had a lot of fun designing the logo and GUI.

The biggest difficulty for me at first was getting used to using C++ and Visual Studio. Between trying to figure out JUCE, C++ and Visual
studio, I spent at least 10 hours troubleshooting and dealing with problems that now seem so simple to me before I even got a functional
line of code.

The biggest challange for me was making the sliders actually connect with the values in the plugin processor. I watchd tutorials over and
over and wrote down everything they did until I figured out how to do it for both sliders.

The only thing I didn't accomplish with this project that I wanted to was to add a tone knob to it.
